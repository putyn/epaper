# epaper 
Adventure with epaper panel to create an epaper wifi connected photoframe.

Project is heavly based on [epdiy project](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy) but with a slightly different hardware, [epaper-breakout](epaper-breakout) is the first iteration of the project which will, hopefully, drive an ED060XC3 panel.
